		<p>AI-driven devices for Prakriti and Nadi Dosh prediction aim to analyze a person’s physical and mental characteristics to determine their Prakriti and detect any imbalances or blockages in their nadis. These devices use machine learning algorithms and data from various sources, such as genetic testing, physiological measurements, and surveys, to predict a person’s Prakriti and Nadi Dosh status.</p>
		<p>Our company offers cutting-edge AI-driven devices that can accurately predict a person’s Prakriti and Nadi Dosh status, allowing for tailored treatment plans and dietary recommendations. Our devices use the latest machine learning algorithms and data from various sources to provide fast and accurate assessments of a person’s constitution and health status.</p>
